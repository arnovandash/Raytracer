This is one of my final semester group projects at WeThinkCode_.

A raytracing engine written in C using the SDL graphics library.
Here we've created a scene file which gets parsed and rendered. The engine also has the ability to render OBJ files as objects in the scene. It supports multiple light sources, different coloured lights, glossy and transparent objects, object colours and light intensity falloff.

Windows port:
